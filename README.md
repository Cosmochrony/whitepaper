Cosmochrony is a **pre-geometric theoretical framework** in which time ordering, spacetime geometry, dynamics, and
matter emerge from the irreversible relaxation of a single **relational substrate**, denoted $\chi$.

The framework does not assume a pre-existing spacetime manifold, metric, or fundamental quantization. Instead, familiar
physical structures are recovered as **regime-dependent effective descriptions**, valid only in projectable regimes,
arising through projection and coarse-graining of the underlying $\chi$ dynamics.

## Core Thesis

Cosmochrony is based on the following central statements:

1. **Time is not fundamental**  
   Time corresponds to the intrinsically directed (irreversible) relaxation or ordering of $\chi$, rather than to an
   external parameter.

2. **Spacetime is emergent**  
   Spacetime geometry arises as an effective, continuum encoding of microscopic relational connectivity, reconstructed
   through spectral methods in appropriate limits.

3. **Observables are projected quantities**  
   Physical observables belong to an effective spacetime-level descriptor $\chi_{eff}$, obtained through a generally
   **non-injective projection** from $\chi$. As a result, effective descriptions can underdetermine the underlying
   configuration and limit reconstruction beyond operational observables.

4. **Dynamics are derived, not postulated**  
   The dynamical law governing $\chi$ and the effective Born–Infeld-like action are obtained *ab initio* from structural
   constraints on relaxation and causal saturation of fluxes. The effective action constitutes an auxiliary encoding
   valid within projectable spacetime regimes, rather than a fundamental postulate.

## The $\chi$ Substrate

- $\chi$ is **not a scalar field defined on spacetime**
- it is a **pre-geometric, relational substrate**
- it does not carry values in space or time
- spacetime notions arise only in projectable regimes

A key distinction is made between:

- **$\chi$**, the fundamental relational substrate
- **$\chi_{eff}$**, an effective scalar descriptor used once a stable geometric regime exists

The mapping $\chi \rightarrow \chi_{eff}$ is generally **non-injective**, constraining reconstruction and playing a
central role in effective indeterminacy and quantum-like behavior.

## Causality and Bounds

Cosmochrony distinguishes between:

- **$c_{\chi}$**: a structural bound governing pre-temporal relaxation fluxes
- **$c$**: the emergent causal constraint within effective spacetime descriptions

This distinction resolves apparent circularities between dynamics and geometry and underlies the recovery of
relativistic causality as an effective limit.

## Matter, Charge, Gravitation, and Spectra

Within Cosmochrony:

- **Localized, stable configurations** of $\chi$ correspond to matter-like excitations
- Stability is characterized by **spectral and topological signatures**, rather than fundamental couplings
- Mass arises from resistance to relaxation, not from a Higgs-type mechanism
- Electric charge is interpreted as a **chiral–torsional invariant** of bounded relaxation fluxes
- Gravitation emerges from sustained constraints on $\chi$ relaxation, recovered as an effective geometric description

Spacetime curvature, time dilation, and gravitational dynamics are obtained as thermodynamic or continuum limits of
relational structure.

## Quantum-like Phenomena

Quantum behavior is not postulated as fundamental.

Instead:

- quantization arises at the effective level
- quantum correlations emerge from shared $\chi$ configurations and projection structure
- nonlocal correlations do not require fundamental superluminal influence
- the wavefunction is an effective descriptor, not an ontological object

## Cosmology and Strong-Gravity Regimes

Cosmological and strong-gravity behavior follow from the same underlying relaxation dynamics:

- large-scale expansion arises from global relaxation structure
- apparent acceleration is cumulative and regime-dependent
- horizon-like thresholds correspond to **deprojection regimes** where effective descriptions become fragile
- black-hole-like behavior is reinterpreted in terms of relaxation saturation and reprojection dynamics

These regimes provide avenues for phenomenological exploration and potential empirical constraints.

## Status of the Framework

Cosmochrony is:

- **foundational and pre-geometric**
- **conceptually closed at the dynamical level**
- **incomplete at the phenomenological and experimental level**

It does **not** claim:

- experimental validation
- full derivation of all Standard Model phenomenology
- final unification

It **does** provide:

- a derived dynamical core
- a coherent ontological structure
- explicit effective limits
- well-defined directions for falsifiable development
