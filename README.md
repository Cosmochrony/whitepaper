Cosmochrony is a **pre-geometric theoretical framework** in which time ordering, spacetime geometry, dynamics, and matter emerge from the irreversible relaxation of a single **relational substrate**, denoted χ.

The framework does not assume a pre-existing spacetime manifold, metric, or fundamental quantization. Instead, familiar physical structures are recovered as **regime-dependent effective descriptions** arising through projection and coarse-graining of the underlying χ dynamics.

## Core Thesis

Cosmochrony is based on the following central statements:

1. **Time is not fundamental**  
   Time corresponds to the intrinsically directed (irreversible) relaxation or ordering of χ, rather than to an external parameter.

2. **Spacetime is emergent**  
   Spacetime geometry arises as an effective, continuum encoding of microscopic relational connectivity, reconstructed through spectral methods in appropriate limits.

3. **Observables are projected quantities**  
   Physical observables belong to an effective spacetime-level descriptor $χ_eff$, obtained through a generally **non-injective projection** from χ. As a result, effective descriptions can underdetermine the underlying configuration.

4. **Dynamics are derived, not postulated**  
   The dynamical law governing χ and the effective Born–Infeld-like action are obtained *ab initio* from structural constraints on relaxation and causal saturation of fluxes.

## The χ Substrate

- χ is **not a scalar field defined on spacetime**
- it is a **pre-geometric, relational substrate**
- it does not carry values in space or time
- spacetime notions arise only in projectable regimes

A key distinction is made between:

- **χ**, the fundamental relational substrate
- **χ_eff**, an effective scalar descriptor used once a stable geometric regime exists

The mapping χ → χ_eff is generally **non-injective**, which constrains reconstruction and plays a central role in the emergence of effective indeterminacy.

## Causality and Bounds

Cosmochrony distinguishes between:

- **c_χ**: a structural bound governing pre-temporal relaxation fluxes
- **c**: the emergent causal constraint within effective spacetime descriptions

This distinction resolves apparent circularities between dynamics and geometry and underlies the recovery of relativistic causality as an effective limit.

## Matter, Gravitation, and Spectra

Within Cosmochrony:

- **Localized, stable configurations** of χ correspond to matter-like excitations
- Stability is characterized by **spectral signatures**, rather than fundamental couplings
- Mass arises from resistance to relaxation, not from a Higgs-type mechanism
- Gravitation emerges from sustained constraints on χ relaxation, recovered as an effective geometric description

Spacetime curvature, time dilation, and gravitational dynamics are obtained as thermodynamic or continuum limits of relational structure.

## Quantum-like Phenomena

Quantum behavior is not postulated as fundamental.

Instead:

- quantization arises at the effective level
- quantum correlations emerge from shared χ configurations and projection structure
- nonlocal correlations do not require fundamental superluminal influence
- the wavefunction is an effective descriptor, not an ontological object

## Cosmology and Strong-Gravity Regimes

Cosmological and strong-gravity behavior follow from the same underlying relaxation dynamics:

- large-scale expansion arises from global relaxation structure
- apparent acceleration is cumulative and regime-dependent
- horizon-like thresholds correspond to deprojection regimes where effective descriptions become fragile
- black-hole-like behavior is reinterpreted in terms of relaxation saturation and reprojection dynamics

## Status of the Framework

Cosmochrony is:

- **foundational and pre-geometric**
- **conceptually closed at the dynamical level**
- **incomplete at the phenomenological and experimental level**

It does **not** claim:

- experimental validation
- full derivation of all Standard Model phenomenology
- final unification

It **does** provide:

- a derived dynamical core
- a coherent ontological structure
- explicit effective limits
- avenues for falsifiable development
