\subsection{Summary}
  \label{subsec:summary6}

  Gravity emerges as a macroscopic effect of localized particle excitations slowing the relaxation of the $\chi$
  field.
  Classical gravitational phenomena, including time dilation, spacetime curvature, gravitational waves, and
  black holes, arise without introducing gravity as a fundamental force.
