\subsection{Gravitational Waves}
  \label{subsec:gravitational-waves}

  Time-dependent variations in excitation density, such as accelerating masses or mergers of compact objects,
  generate propagating disturbances in the $\chi$ field.
  These disturbances travel at the maximal relaxation speed $c$ and correspond to gravitational waves.

  Unlike electromagnetic radiation, gravitational waves represent collective modulations of $\chi$
  itself rather than excitations propagating within it.
