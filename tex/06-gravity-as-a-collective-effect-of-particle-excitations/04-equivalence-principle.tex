\subsection{Equivalence Principle}
  \label{subsec:equivalence-principle}

  Because all particle excitations interact with $\chi$ through the same mechanism, the slowdown of $\chi$
  relaxation is independent of the internal composition of matter.
  As a result, all bodies experience identical gravitational acceleration in a given $\chi$ gradient.

  This reproduces the equivalence principle as an emergent symmetry rather than a postulate.
