\subsection{Emergent Curvature}
  \label{subsec:emergent-curvature}

  Spatial variations in the relaxation rate of $\chi$, together with the collective modulation of
  the effective coupling between neighboring regions, induce gradients that effectively curve
  spacetime.

  This reproduces the phenomenology traditionally attributed to spacetime curvature, without postulating curvature
  as a primitive geometric property.
