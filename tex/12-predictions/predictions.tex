\section{Testable Predictions and Observational Signatures}
  \label{sec:testable-predictions-and-observational-signatures}

  Before detailing specific observational signatures, it is important to clarify
  the epistemic status of the numerical estimates presented in this section.
  Values such as the $\sim 8$--$10\%$ offset between early- and late-time effective
  determinations of the Hubble constant or the $\sim 10^{-10}\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ drift in effective spacetime observables
  are not proposed as precision predictions.
  They should be understood as order-of-magnitude consistency estimates derived
  from the geometric coupling between the $\chi$ field and the effective relaxation
  fraction $\Omega_\chi$.

  Their role is to demonstrate that the Cosmochrony framework operates within a
  phenomenologically relevant regime, capable of addressing current observational
  tensions without fine-tuning or the introduction of additional dynamical degrees
  of freedom.
