\subsection{Summary}
  \label{subsec:summary-predictions}

  Cosmochrony yields a set of observationally testable phenomenological signatures
  across cosmology, gravitation, and quantum phenomena.
  While these features remain compatible with current observations, the framework
  generically allows for correlated departures from standard predictions that may
  become accessible to future high-precision measurements.

  Taken together, these signatures provide concrete avenues for empirical scrutiny.
  The confirmation or falsification of any subset of them would directly constrain
  the viability of Cosmochrony as a physical framework.
