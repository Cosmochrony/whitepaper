\subsection{Large-Angle Temperature Anomalies}
  \label{subsec:large-angle-anomalies}

  Large-angle anomalies observed in the cosmic microwave background, such as the
  suppression of power at low multipoles and the presence of unexpected large-scale
  alignments, remain only partially explained within the standard $\Lambda$CDM
  framework~\cite{Planck2018}.

  Within the Cosmochrony framework, these features are naturally interpreted as
  residual relational correlations inherited from the pre-geometric regime of the
  $\chi$ substrate.
  Before the emergence of a stable spacetime description, relational structure was
  not organized according to spatial separation or causal horizons.
  As a result, long-range correlations could persist without requiring superluminal
  processes or inflationary amplification.

  When geometric projection becomes admissible, most of these correlations are
  washed out by subsequent relaxation and structure formation.
  However, weak remnants may survive at the largest angular scales, where cosmic
  variance is dominant and effective geometric descriptions are least constraining.

  In this perspective, large-angle CMB anomalies do not signal a breakdown of
  cosmological consistency.
  They reflect the partial imprint of a pre-geometric relational phase on the earliest
  projectable spacetime observables, and are therefore expected to appear primarily at
  the largest scales.
