\subsection{Cosmic Microwave Background}
  \label{subsec:cmb}

  Within the Cosmochrony framework, the cosmic microwave background (CMB) does not
  encode primordial fluctuations generated during a distinct inflationary phase.
  It reflects instead the imprint of early relaxation and reprojection processes as
  the relational $\chi$ substrate transitioned toward a regime admitting stable
  geometric descriptions.

  At this stage, the universe was not yet structured by well-defined spatial
  separation or causal horizons.
  Large-scale correlations observed in the CMB therefore arise naturally from the
  global relational coherence of $\chi$ prior to geometric differentiation, rather
  than from superluminal expansion within spacetime.

  The acoustic features observed in the temperature power spectrum admit an effective
  interpretation as resonance patterns arising during the transition to a stable
  geometric regime.
  They reflect the coupling between emerging matter configurations and the
  relaxation dynamics governing admissible projected descriptions, rather than
  oscillations of a fundamental physical field~\cite{SachsWolfe1967,HuWhite1997}.

  In this perspective, the CMB encodes a fossil record of the emergence of spacetime
  itself.
  Its large-angle correlations and statistical properties are consequences of the
  pre-geometric relational structure of $\chi$, inherited by the emergent spacetime
  description without requiring an inflationary epoch or superluminal causal
  processes~\cite{Planck2020}.
