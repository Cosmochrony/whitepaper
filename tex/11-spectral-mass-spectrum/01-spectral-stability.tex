\subsection{Spectral Stability and the Unit of Mass}
  \label{sec:spectral-stability}

  In the Cosmochrony framework, the rest mass $m$
      of an excitation is defined as the fundamental eigenfrequency of the spectral Laplacian $\Delta^{(0)}_G$
      acting upon the fiber $\Pi$ under specific topological constraints $\mathcal{T}$:
  \begin{equation}
    m^2 \cdot c^2 = \text{Eig}(\Delta^{(0)}_G) \Big|_{\mathcal{T}}
  \end{equation}
  The mass of the electron ($m_e$) serves as the reference mode ($\lambda_1$
      ), representing the simplest stable resonance of the substrate $\chi$ within the $S^3$
      fiber geometry. The conversion from dimensionless eigenvalues to physical units (MeV) is anchored by this
      fundamental resonance.
