\subsection{Unified Origin of Geometric and Field Effects}
  \label{subsec:unified-origin}

  The relationship between the $\chi$ field and the effective metric $g_{\mu\nu}$ is strictly hierarchical, reflecting
  the transition from fundamental relations to smooth geometry:

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Primacy of the Network:} The fundamental layer consists of the relational $\chi$-network where the connectivity matrix $K_{ij}$ dictates the flow of information and the local relaxation rate.
    \item \textbf{Geometric Emergence:} The metric $g_{\mu\nu}$ is an emergent statistical description of these connections.
    It represents the ``density of correlation'' within the field and acts as a coarse-grained summary
    for macroscopic observers.
    \item \textbf{The Hydrodynamic Analogy:} Just as pressure and temperature emerge from molecular collisions without acting back as independent ontological forces, the metric $g_{\mu\nu}$ encodes the state of the $\chi$ field.
    Gravitation is the manifestation of $\chi$-solitons (matter) locally modulating the network's connectivity.
  \end{enumerate}

  In this framework, the field equations are solved on the fundamental graph.
  The resulting configuration naturally defines the effective spacetime geometry, ensuring that gravitation and matter
  are two aspects of the same underlying $\chi$ dynamics.
