\section{Introduction}
  \label{sec:introduction}

  Modern fundamental physics rests on two remarkably successful yet conceptually distinct
theoretical frameworks: quantum mechanics and general relativity~\cite{dirac1930principles, einstein1915feldgleichungen}.
Quantum theory provides an extraordinarily accurate description of microscopic phenomena,
while general relativity offers a geometric account of gravitation and spacetime dynamics
at macroscopic and cosmological scales\cite{Dirac1930,Einstein1915}.
Despite their empirical success, these theories remain difficult to reconcile within a single
coherent conceptual and mathematical framework~\cite{MisnerThorneWheeler1973,Weinberg1972,misner1973gravitation,rovelli2004quantum}.

A central obstacle to this reconciliation lies in their incompatible foundational assumptions.
Quantum mechanics presupposes a fixed spacetime background on which states evolve, whereas
general relativity identifies spacetime geometry itself as a dynamical entity.
Attempts to bridge this gap have led to a wide range of approaches, including quantum field
theory in curved spacetime, canonical and covariant quantum gravity programs, as well as
string-based and holographic frameworks.
While these efforts have yielded deep insights, they typically rely on extended mathematical
structures, additional dimensions, or large numbers of degrees of freedom, and often introduce
elements whose empirical accessibility remains uncertain.

In this article, we explore a complementary and deliberately minimalist approach, referred to
as \emph{Cosmochrony}.
The guiding hypothesis is that spacetime geometry, gravitation, and quantum phenomena may
emerge from the dynamics of a single continuous geometric substrate, described by a scalar
quantity denoted $\chi$.
Crucially, $\chi$ is not introduced as a field propagating on a pre-existing spacetime
background.
Rather, spacetime notions themselves are treated as effective descriptions that arise from
the relational and dynamical properties of $\chi$ configurations.

The central dynamical postulate of Cosmochrony is that $\chi$ undergoes an irreversible
relaxation process, locally bounded by the invariant propagation speed $c$.
This monotonic evolution establishes an intrinsic ordering of physical processes, which is
identified with the arrow of time.
Spatial separation, in turn, is interpreted as a relational structure emerging from differences
and gradients in $\chi$ once a stable geometric regime is reached.
Within this framework, spacetime expansion, gravitation, particle-like excitations, radiation
processes, and quantum correlations are not fundamental ingredients, but emergent phenomena
associated with specific configurations or interactions of the underlying field.

The aim of the present work is not to propose a complete or final unification of quantum
theory and gravitation.
Rather, it seeks to formulate a minimal and internally coherent dynamical framework, and to
examine the extent to which its qualitative structure and phenomenological consequences are
compatible with established physical observations.
In particular, we investigate how cosmological expansion, particle properties, gravitational
effects, radiation, and quantum entanglement may be consistently reinterpreted within a
single geometric setting governed by the dynamics of $\chi$.

Cosmochrony does not attempt to replace the Standard Model or General Relativity in their
well-tested domains.
Instead, it offers a unifying geometric interpretation in which quantization, spacetime
curvature, and cosmic expansion emerge from a common relaxation dynamics rather than being
introduced as independent postulates.
In this sense, the framework is best viewed as an exploratory research program aimed at
clarifying the conceptual relationships between time, geometry, and quantum phenomena.

The structure of the paper is as follows.
Section~2 introduces the conceptual motivations and theoretical context underlying the
approach.
Sections~3 and~4 define the $\chi$ field and outline its minimal dynamical properties.
Sections~5 and~6 examine the emergence of particle-like excitations and gravitation within
this framework.
Section~7 discusses quantum correlations and measurement as physical processes associated
with $\chi$ configurations.
Section~8 shows how the standard quantum-mechanical formalism arises as an effective
description.
Sections~9 and~10 explore cosmological and radiative implications, followed by testable
predictions in Section~11.
Sections~12 and~13 conclude with a comparative discussion and outlook.
