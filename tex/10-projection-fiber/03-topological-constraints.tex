\subsection{Topological Constraints and Invariants}
  \label{sec:topological-constraints}

  The stability of particles within $\Pi$
      is governed by the conservation of topological invariants. Any excitation of the substrate that forms a closed
      loop (a knot) within $\Pi$ becomes a permanent ``obstruction'' to global relaxation.

  The winding number $w$
      , which is used to derive the mass spectrum in the following chapter, is the primary invariant characterizing
      these obstructions. The energy cost of maintaining such a knot against the pressure of relaxation is what we
      perceive as ``rest energy'' ($mc^2$).
