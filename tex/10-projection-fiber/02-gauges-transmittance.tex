\subsection{Gauges as Relaxation Transmittance}
  \label{sec:gauges-transmittance}

  The fundamental forces are reinterpreted here as the degrees of freedom of the relaxation flow within $\Pi$:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Electromagnetism ($U(1)$):}
    Corresponds to the phase of the relaxation flow along the fibers of the Hopf bundle. The fine structure constant
    $\alpha$ measures the global ``transmittance'' of this flow through the fiber.
    \item \textbf{Weak Interaction ($SU(2)$):} Emerges from the rotational degrees of freedom of the $S^3$
    fiber itself. The massive nature of the $W$ and $Z$
    bosons is a direct consequence of the ``spectral drag'' (torsion) within the fiber.
    \item \textbf{Strong Interaction ($SU(3)$):}
    Relates to the color symmetry induced by the triality of the windings. In this framework, the $SU(3)$
    symmetry is the geometric consequence of the three-fold symmetry of the trefoil knot ($w=3$
    ), representing the first level of self-intersecting topological stability.
  \end{itemize}
