\subsection{Influence of Local Structure}
  \label{subsec:influence-of-local-structure}

  In regions where the effective structural variations of $\chi$ are non-vanishing,
  the local relaxation rate of the field is reduced.
  This slowdown plays a central role in the emergence of gravitational phenomena
  within the Cosmochrony framework.

  Localized excitations---identified with particle-like solitonic configurations of
  $\chi$---act as dynamical or topological constraints on the relaxation flow.
  By enhancing the local structural complexity of $\chi$, they reduce the effective
  rate at which the field can relax toward equilibrium.

  When described in effective geometric terms, this mechanism manifests as
  gravitational time dilation and spatial curvature.
  No independent gravitational field is postulated; gravitation emerges as a
  collective consequence of locally constrained relaxation dynamics.
