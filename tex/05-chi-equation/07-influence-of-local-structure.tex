\subsection{Influence of Local Structure}
  \label{subsec:influence-of-local-structure}

  In regions where projected $\chi$ configurations exhibit non-vanishing effective
  structural variations, the admissible local relaxation ordering is reduced.
  This reduction constitutes a central mechanism underlying the emergence of
  gravitational phenomena within the Cosmochrony framework.

  Localized relaxation-resistant configurations—describable in effective regimes as
  particle-like solitonic structures—act as constraints on the admissible ordering of
  projected $\chi$ configurations.
  By increasing the effective structural complexity of the projected description, they
  locally inhibit relaxation without introducing any additional interaction,
  mediator, or force.

  When a geometric description becomes applicable, this inhibition manifests
  phenomenologically as gravitational time dilation and spatial curvature.
  No independent gravitational field or degree of freedom is postulated.
  Gravitation arises instead as a collective and emergent consequence of locally
  constrained effective relaxation ordering induced by structured projected
  configurations.
