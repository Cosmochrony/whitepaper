\subsection{Parameter-Independent Relaxation}
  \label{subsec:parameter-independent-relaxation}

  To avoid the conceptual pitfalls associated with a fundamental time coordinate,
  the Cosmochrony framework formulates physical evolution without reference to any
  external temporal parameter.
  At the fundamental level, $\chi$ does not evolve in time and admits no temporal
  parameterization.
  Instead, physical evolution is described at the effective level as an ordered
  sequence of projected $\chi$ configurations, denoted
  $(\chi_{\mathrm{eff},\lambda})$, where $\lambda$ is a strictly monotonic ordering
  parameter labeling admissible stages of relaxation within projected descriptions.

  This ordering parameter does not represent time, nor does it parametrize a
  fundamental trajectory of $\chi$.
  It serves only to label the relational ordering of projected configurations once a
  macroscopic spacetime description becomes applicable.
  No fundamental dynamics unfolds with respect to $\lambda$ at the level of the
  $\chi$ substrate itself.

  Accordingly, no fundamental evolution equation is postulated for $\chi$.
  Instead, admissible projected descriptions are constrained by an effective
  relaxation condition of the form
  \begin{equation}
    \mathcal{D}_{\lambda}\chi_{\mathrm{eff}} = \mathcal{R}[\chi_{\mathrm{eff}}],
  \end{equation}
  where $\mathcal{R}[\chi_{\mathrm{eff}}]$ denotes an effective relaxation functional
  characterizing the ordering of projected $\chi$ configurations.
  This functional is defined only within regimes admitting a stable geometric
  interpretation and carries no meaning at the fundamental level.
  No spacetime derivative, metric structure, or geometric operator is assumed in the
  definition of $\mathcal{R}$.

  Quantities commonly interpreted as temporal derivatives arise exclusively at the
  level of effective descriptions.
  When projected $\chi$ configurations exhibit sufficient regularity, a coordinate
  time parameter may be introduced as a convenient label for the relaxation ordering.
  Such a parameter has no fundamental significance and does not modify the underlying
  structural constraints imposed by $\chi$.

  Within this framework, relaxation does not occur \emph{in} time.
  Rather, the ordering of projected $\chi$ configurations defines what is
  operationally identified as physical duration.
  Local variations in the effective relaxation ordering provide the phenomenological
  measure of temporal flow, establishing a direct connection between the structure of
  projected descriptions and the emergent notion of time.
