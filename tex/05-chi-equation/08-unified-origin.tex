\subsection{Unified Origin of Geometric and Field Effects}
  \label{subsec:unified-origin}

  The relationship between the $\chi$ field and the effective spacetime metric
  $g_{\mu\nu}$ is strictly hierarchical, reflecting the transition from fundamental
  pre-geometric relations to smooth geometric descriptions.

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Primacy of $\chi$:}
    At the fundamental level, physical reality is described solely in terms of the
    continuous scalar quantity $\chi$ and its relational structure.
    The dynamics of $\chi$ is governed by intrinsic relaxation processes, without
    reference to spacetime, metric geometry, or gravitational degrees of freedom.

    \item \textbf{Emergent Geometry:}
    In regimes where $\chi$ configurations admit a stable and slowly varying
    description, geometric notions become meaningful.
    The spacetime metric $g_{\mu\nu}$ arises as an effective descriptor summarizing
    the correlations and relaxation properties of $\chi$, providing a convenient
    coarse-grained language for macroscopic observers.

    \item \textbf{Unified Interpretation of Fields and Gravitation:}
    Within this effective geometric description, localized solitonic configurations
    of $\chi$ are identified with matter, while gravitation corresponds to the local
    modulation of relaxation induced by these structures.
    The metric does not act as an independent dynamical agent, but encodes the
    collective response of the $\chi$ field to such localized constraints.
  \end{enumerate}

  In this framework, no independent gravitational interaction is postulated.
  Matter, geometry, and gravitational phenomena emerge as complementary aspects of
  the same underlying relaxation dynamics of $\chi$, ensuring a unified and
  self-consistent description across scales.
