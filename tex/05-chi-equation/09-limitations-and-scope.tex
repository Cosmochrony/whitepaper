\subsection{Limitations and Scope}
  \label{subsec:limitations-and-scope}

  Equation~\eqref{eq:chi_dynamics} is intentionally minimal and does not describe a
  fundamental dynamics of the $\chi$ substrate.
  It constrains admissible projected descriptions in regimes where a stable geometric
  interpretation becomes applicable.
  In particular, it does not aim to provide a complete account of quantum fluctuations
  or correlations at the level of the $\chi$ substrate, nor does it incorporate
  higher-order structural effects beyond the effective description.

  Within this scope, the equation provides a unified kinematic backbone from which
  gravitational, quantum, and cosmological phenomena can be consistently
  \emph{described} or \emph{recovered} at an effective level.
  These phenomena are not derived from first principles at the level of $\chi$, but
  emerge as structured regularities within admissible projected descriptions once
  coarse-graining and geometric interpretation are introduced.

  More refined treatments of effective fluctuations, correlations, and extended
  relational structures lie beyond the present formulation.
  Such developments would require a deeper analysis of the space of admissible
  projected configurations and of the stability properties of the corresponding
  effective descriptions.

  In the following sections, this constrained descriptive framework is applied to
  particle-like excitations, gravitation, and quantum correlations, where its
  explanatory power can be directly assessed within its intended domain of validity.
