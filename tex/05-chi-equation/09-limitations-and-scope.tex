\subsection{Limitations and Scope}
  \label{subsec:limitations-and-scope}

  Equation~\eqref{eq:chi_dynamics} is intentionally minimal.
  It does not aim to provide a complete description of quantum fluctuations of
  $\chi$, nor does it incorporate higher-order backreaction effects.
  Its role is to capture the essential kinematic constraint governing the
  relaxation of $\chi$ in regimes where an effective geometric interpretation
  applies.

  Within this scope, the equation provides a unified backbone from which
  gravitational, quantum, and cosmological phenomena can be consistently
  \emph{recovered} or \emph{described} at an effective level, rather than derived
  from first principles.
  More refined treatments of fluctuations, correlations, and non-local structures
  lie beyond the present formulation and motivate further developments of the
  framework.

  In the following sections, this dynamical structure is applied to particles,
  gravitation, and entanglement, where its explanatory power can be directly
  assessed.
