\subsection{Causality and Locality}
  \label{subsec:causality-and-locality}

  Equation~\eqref{eq:chi_dynamics} defines a dynamics that is local and causal at the
  fundamental level.
  The relaxation of $\chi$ in any given configuration depends only on its immediate
  relational neighborhood, as defined by local variations of $\chi$ itself.
  No nonlocal influence or instantaneous coupling is introduced.

  Causality is enforced through the existence of a universal bound on the local
  relaxation rate of $\chi$, ensuring that correlations propagate only through
  successive neighboring configurations.
  This bound plays the role of an effective causal constraint, without presupposing
  a spacetime lightcone structure.

  At the fundamental level, no superluminal propagation occurs.
  Apparent superluminal recession velocities observed in cosmological settings arise
  only from the cumulative integration of local relaxation effects over extended
  regions, and are therefore fully consistent with local causality as defined within
  the Cosmochrony framework.
