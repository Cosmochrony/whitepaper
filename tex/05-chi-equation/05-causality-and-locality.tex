\subsection{Causality and Locality}
  \label{subsec:causality-and-locality}

  Equation~\eqref{eq:chi_dynamics} does not define a fundamental dynamics of the
  $\chi$ substrate.
  Rather, it constrains admissible projected descriptions in regimes where a
  geometric interpretation becomes applicable.
  Within such effective descriptions, the relaxation ordering encoded by
  $\chi_{\mathrm{eff}}$ is local and causal in the operational sense relevant to
  physical observables.

  Effective locality follows from the fact that variations of
  $\chi_{\mathrm{eff}}$ at a given effective spacetime event depend only on
  correlated neighboring projected configurations, as defined within the emergent
  geometric description.
  No instantaneous coupling or nonlocal influence is introduced at the level of
  effective physical observables.

  Causality is enforced through the existence of a universal bound on the effective
  local relaxation ordering,
  \[
    \left| \mathcal{D}_{\mathrm{loc}} \chi_{\mathrm{eff}} \right| \le c ,
  \]
  which constrains how rapidly correlations between effective configurations may
  be established.
  This bound functions as an effective causal constraint without presupposing a
  fundamental spacetime or lightcone structure.

  At the level of effective physical descriptions, no superluminal propagation of
  signals or causal influence occurs.
  Apparent superluminal recession velocities observed in cosmological settings arise
  only from the cumulative integration of locally constrained relaxation ordering
  over extended regions.
  They therefore remain fully consistent with effective locality and causality as
  defined within the Cosmochrony framework.
