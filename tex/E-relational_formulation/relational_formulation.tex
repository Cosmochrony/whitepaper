\section{Relational Formulation of \texorpdfstring{$\chi$}{χ} Dynamics}
  \label{app:relational_formulation}

  This appendix develops a fully relational and explicitly non-geometric formulation
  of the dynamics of the \(\chi\) field.
  Its purpose is to make explicit the ontological foundations underlying the
  Cosmochrony framework, independently of any effective spacetime or metric-based
  description.

  The constructions presented here are not required for the operational,
  projected dynamics discussed in the main text.
  Rather, they serve to clarify how particle-like properties, topological stability,
  and quantum correlations may arise from the intrinsic relational structure of
  \(\chi\), prior to the emergence of geometry.
  In this sense, the appendix complements—but does not extend—the effective
  dynamical framework developed elsewhere.

  \paragraph{Status and scope.}
    The relational formulation does not assume:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item a background spacetime or metric,
      \item spatial localization or distance,
      \item a tensorial or spinorial fundamental ontology,
      \item or an underlying Hilbert space structure.
    \end{itemize}

    Instead, it treats \(\chi\) as a single relational substrate whose configurations
    are defined entirely by internal structural relations and bounded relaxation
    constraints.
    Concepts such as position, duration, causal order, and particle identity emerge
    only at the level of effective projection and are therefore absent from the
    foundational description presented here.

  \paragraph{Relational origin of particle properties.}
    Within this framework, particle-like excitations are identified with internally
    stable relational configurations of \(\chi\).
    Their apparent properties—such as mass, charge, spin, and statistics—are not
    assigned a priori.
    They emerge from topological and organizational features of relational
    configurations once a projectable regime becomes applicable.

    The constructions developed in this appendix illustrate how:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item particle identity corresponds to relational equivalence classes,
      \item charge reflects oriented asymmetries in relaxation constraints,
      \item spin arises from nontrivial transformation properties of configuration
      space,
      \item fermionic and bosonic behavior follow from topological obstructions to
      continuous factorization.
    \end{itemize}

    These mechanisms are presented as existence proofs rather than as a unique or
    exhaustive classification of physical particles.

  \paragraph{Relation to quantum phenomena.}
    Several core features of quantum physics—most notably non-factorization,
    entanglement, and spin--statistics correlations—acquire a natural interpretation
    within the relational formulation.
    In Cosmochrony, these phenomena are not imposed through quantization rules.
    They reflect the holistic structure of \(\chi\) configurations that cannot be
    decomposed into independent subsystems once relationally coupled.

    This perspective aligns with, but is distinct from, other non-local or
    pre-geometric approaches.
    It emphasizes structural coherence rather than signal propagation or information
    exchange.

  \paragraph{Relation to effective geometric descriptions.}
    The relational formulation provides the ontological underpinning for the effective
    geometric descriptions introduced elsewhere in the paper.
    Once coarse-graining and projection become valid, relational configurations admit
    approximate geometric representations in terms of fields on spacetime.
    The correspondence between the relational and geometric levels is many-to-one and
    regime-dependent.

    Importantly, no contradiction arises between the relational and geometric
    descriptions.
    They apply to different descriptive levels of the same underlying dynamics.

  \paragraph{Purpose of the appendix.}
    This appendix serves three complementary roles:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item to demonstrate that Cosmochrony admits a fully non-geometric formulation,
      \item to clarify the ontological meaning of particle-like excitations and quantum
      correlations,
      \item to prevent misinterpretations that would reintroduce spacetime or quantum
      postulates at the fundamental level.
    \end{itemize}

    Readers interested primarily in phenomenology or effective dynamics may skip this
    appendix without loss of continuity.
    Readers concerned with the conceptual foundations and internal coherence of the
    framework may find the relational formulation essential.
