\subsection{Weakly Interacting Radiation}
  \label{subsec:weakly-interacting-radiation}

  In the Cosmochrony framework, weakly interacting radiation does not correspond to
  fundamentally different particle species, but to $\chi$ disturbances whose
  structural contrast and curvature are insufficient to efficiently induce
  localized reprojection when encountering matter.

  Low-frequency electromagnetic disturbances or weakly coupled excitation patterns
  are characterized by smooth, slowly varying relational structure.
  As a result, their interaction with localized $\chi$ configurations is rare:
  the probability that such disturbances trigger a stable localized energy transfer
  upon interaction is strongly suppressed.

  This explains the effective transparency of vacuum to most radiation.
  Propagation corresponds to the persistence of a coherent $\chi$ disturbance across
  extended regions, while detection events occur only when local structural conditions
  allow reprojection into a localized excitation.

  In this sense, small interaction cross sections do not reflect the weakness of a
  fundamental force, but the low likelihood that a given disturbance of $\chi$
  satisfies the geometric and topological conditions required for localized
  reprojection.
