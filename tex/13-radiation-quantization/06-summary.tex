\subsection{Summary}
  \label{subsec:summary-radiation-quantization}

  In Cosmochrony, radiation and quantization arise from interactions between localized
  matter excitations and the $\chi$ field.
  Photon-like events emerge only during interaction-induced reprojection, rather than
  corresponding to pre-existing independent entities.

  Quantization reflects geometric and topological constraints of $\chi$ dynamics:
  discrete energy transfer occurs when continuous $\chi$ disturbances satisfy the
  conditions required for localized reprojection.
  In this sense, quantization is not fundamental discreteness, but an emergent
  manifestation of constrained relaxation and interaction geometry.
