\section{Conceptual Extensions of Cosmochrony — Particles, Quantum Phenomena, and Classical Limits}
  \label{sec:appendix-conceptual}

  This appendix develops a set of conceptual and phenomenological extensions of the
  Cosmochrony framework.
  Its purpose is not to introduce additional postulates or to strengthen the internal
  consistency of the theory, but to illustrate how familiar particle, quantum, and
  classical structures may emerge once the $\chi$ field admits localized and stable
  configurations.

  In particular, this appendix addresses:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item the ontological status of the $\chi$ field and its interpretation as a
    pre-geometric relational substrate
    (Section~\ref{subsec:nature-chi}),
    \item the description of particles as topological solitons of $\chi$, including
    explicit constructions for fermionic and bosonic configurations
    (Sections~\ref{app:topological_solitons}--\ref{subsec:4pi_soliton}),
    \item the emergence of classical limits and the interpretation of quantum-to-classical
    transitions
    (Sections~\ref{subsec:classical-limits}--\ref{subsec:status-formulation}),
    \item and perspectives on deriving particle mass spectra from the internal dynamics
    and stability properties of the $\chi$ field
    (Section~\ref{subsec:perspectives_mass_spectrum}).
  \end{itemize}

  These developments serve as a conceptual bridge between the mathematical foundations
  presented in Appendix~\ref{sec:appendix-math} and the cosmological and observational
  considerations discussed in Appendix~\ref{sec:appendix-cosmo}.
  They demonstrate how the minimal ontological assumptions of Cosmochrony can support
  a rich hierarchy of effective physical phenomena without requiring additional
  fundamental degrees of freedom.

  None of the constructions presented in this appendix are required for the logical
  coherence or internal consistency of the Cosmochrony framework.
  The core theory remains fully defined by the relational relaxation dynamics of the
  $\chi$ field.
  Rather, the material collected here illustrates how particle-like excitations,
  quantization, and classical behavior may arise naturally as emergent features when
  $\chi$ organizes into localized, topologically stable configurations.
