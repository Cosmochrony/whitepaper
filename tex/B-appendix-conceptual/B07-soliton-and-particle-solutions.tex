\subsection{Soliton and Particle Solutions}
  \label{subsec:soliton-and-particle-solutions}

  Within the Cosmochrony framework, elementary particles are interpreted as stable
  or metastable localized configurations of the $\chi$ field, hereafter referred
  to as $\chi$-solitons~\cite{Rajaraman1982}.
  These configurations arise from nonlinear self-organization of the $\chi$
  dynamics and persist as localized resistances to global relaxation.

  While the fundamental degree of freedom is scalar, certain solitonic
  configurations exhibit an intrinsic internal structure that cannot be faithfully
  described by scalar variables alone.
  In particular, configurations characterized by nontrivial phase winding and
  $4\pi$-periodicity require a double-valued representation under rotations.
  In such cases, an effective spinorial description becomes unavoidable.

  At the phenomenological level, these excitations admit a representation in terms
  of Dirac spinors, not as fundamental fields, but as emergent collective variables
  encoding the internal degrees of freedom of $\chi$-solitons.
  The Dirac equation then appears as the minimal effective dynamical description
  compatible with:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item locality at the coarse-grained level,
    \item relativistic covariance,
    \item and the topological constraint imposed by $4\pi$-periodic configurations.
  \end{itemize}

  From this perspective, the Dirac structure does not introduce new ontological
  entities.
  Rather, it provides a compact and universal encoding of the internal topology
  and spectral properties of fermionic $\chi$-solitons.
  Spin, statistics, and the associated exclusion principle follow from this
  structure as effective consequences of the underlying scalar dynamics.

  The existence and stability of $\chi$-solitons impose structural constraints on
  the effective self-interaction functional governing the field dynamics.
  While the explicit form of this functional remains undetermined, it must satisfy
  the following minimal requirements:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item support for localized finite-energy configurations,
    \item stability under small perturbations,
    \item and the existence of topologically inequivalent sectors corresponding to
    distinct particle species.
  \end{enumerate}

  The detailed derivation of effective Dirac dynamics from $\chi$-soliton
  fluctuations, as well as the associated mass spectrum, remains an open
  mathematical problem.
  It is addressed at a programmatic level in
  Sections~\ref{app:topological_solitons}--\ref{subsec:4pi_soliton} and in
  Appendix~\ref{subsec:perspectives_mass_spectrum}.
