\section{Discussion and Comparison with Existing Frameworks}
  \label{sec:discussion-and-comparison-with-existing-frameworks}

  The Cosmochrony framework proposes a minimal pre-geometric substrate, described by
  a single scalar quantity $\chi$, whose irreversible relaxation underlies both
  microscopic and cosmological phenomena.
  Spacetime geometry, gravitational dynamics, and quantum behavior arise only as
  effective descriptions of this underlying relaxation process.

  In this section, we discuss how this approach relates to established theoretical
  frameworks, highlight its conceptual implications, and identify open challenges.
  Particular emphasis is placed on clarifying points of contact and distinction with
  general relativity, quantum mechanics, and standard cosmological models, as well as
  on assessing the ontological and methodological economy of the framework.

  The goal is not to claim empirical superiority over existing theories, but to
  clarify the conceptual role of Cosmochrony as a deeper explanatory layer from which
  standard frameworks emerge in appropriate regimes.
