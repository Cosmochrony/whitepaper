\section{Mathematical Foundations of Cosmochrony — Dynamics, Stability, and Analytical Solutions}
  \label{sec:appendix-math}

  This appendix provides a rigorous mathematical formulation of the $\chi$-field
  dynamics underlying the Cosmochrony framework.
  Its purpose is not to introduce new physical assumptions, but to support the
  effective descriptions developed in the main text by establishing the internal
  consistency, stability properties, and analytical structure of the underlying
  field equations.

  In particular, this appendix presents:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item an effective Lagrangian formulation and its hydrodynamic limit
    (Section~\ref{subsec:hydrodynamic-limit}),
    \item stability analyses of the $\chi$ field under perturbations
    (Section~\ref{subsec:stability-analysis}),
    \item analytical solutions in homogeneous, spherically symmetric, and planar
    regimes (Section~\ref{subsec:analytical-solutions}),
    \item and the relational foundation of emergent geometric descriptions
    (Section~\ref{app:relational_formulation}).
  \end{itemize}

  All results are derived from the fundamental postulates of Cosmochrony
  (Section~\ref{subsec:geometric-action}) without assuming a pre-existing spacetime
  metric or background geometry.
  Geometric notions appearing in this appendix should therefore be understood as
  effective and coarse-grained representations of the underlying $\chi$ dynamics,
  consistent with the interpretative framework developed in Appendix~\cite{sec:appendix-technical}.

  No additional physical assumptions are introduced in this appendix; all results
  follow from reformulations, approximations, or limiting regimes of the same
  underlying $\chi$ dynamics discussed in the main text.

  Several structures derived here—such as relaxation bounds, stability spectra, and
  effective coupling scalings—provide the mathematical basis for the phenomenological
  signatures discussed in Section~\ref{sec:testable-predictions-and-observational-signatures},
  without constituting independent predictive postulates.
