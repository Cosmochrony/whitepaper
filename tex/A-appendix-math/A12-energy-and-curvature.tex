\subsection{Energy and Curvature}
  \label{subsec:energy-and-curvature}

  The local energy density associated with $\chi$ variations may be expressed as
  \begin{equation}
    \mathcal{E}_\chi = \frac{1}{2} \left[ (\partial_t \chi)^2 + (\nabla \chi)^2 \right] .
  \end{equation}

  Regions of high curvature in $\chi$ correspond to localized energy concentrations and are identified with particle-like
  excitations.
  Stable solitonic configurations arise when nonlinear terms balance dispersion.
