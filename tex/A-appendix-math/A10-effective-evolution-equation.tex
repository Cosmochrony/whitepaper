\subsection{Effective Evolution Equation}
  \label{subsec:effective-evolution-equation}

  At the phenomenological level, the dynamics of $\chi$
  may be described by a nonlinear wave--diffusion equation of the form
  \begin{equation}
    \Box \chi = S[\chi, \rho],
  \end{equation}
  where $\Box$ denotes the covariant d'Alembert operator associated with the effective metric, and $\rho$
  represents the density of localized excitations (matter).

  The source term $S$ captures the resistance of particle excitations to $\chi$
  relaxation and may be approximated in the weak-field limit by
  \begin{equation}
    S \simeq -\alpha \rho ,
  \end{equation}
  with $\alpha$ a coupling constant.
