\subsection{Relational Foundation and Emergent Geometry}
  \label{subsec:relational-foundation-pointer}

  The formulation developed in the main text adopts a continuous description of the
  $\chi$ field as a pre-geometric substrate.
  This choice is motivated by conceptual economy and by the direct connection it
  provides with effective field-theoretic and cosmological descriptions.

  It is important to emphasize, however, that the emergence of geometric notions in
  Cosmochrony does not rely on this continuous representation.
  A fully relational formulation, in which temporal ordering, distance, and effective
  geometry are reconstructed from internal correlations of $\chi$ without assuming
  any background spacetime structure, is presented separately in
  Appendix~\ref{app:relational_formulation}.

  That appendix demonstrates explicitly that the metric and spacetime geometry are not
  fundamental ingredients of the theory, but effective descriptors of relational
  $\chi$ dynamics.
  The present subsection therefore serves only to clarify the logical status of the
  continuous formulation adopted in the main text.
