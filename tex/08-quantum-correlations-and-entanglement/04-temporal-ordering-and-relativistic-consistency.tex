\subsection{Temporal Ordering and Relativistic Consistency}
  \label{subsec:temporal-ordering-and-relativistic-consistency}

  Within the Cosmochrony framework, temporal ordering is not defined by a global notion
  of simultaneity.
  It arises at the level of effective descriptions as an ordering of admissible
  projected events, induced by constrained relaxation ordering rather than by an
  absolute time parameter.

  Different observers may assign different temporal orderings to spacelike separated
  events within effective geometric descriptions, without affecting the underlying
  relational consistency of admissible projections.
  No preferred foliation or absolute temporal structure is selected at the fundamental
  level.

  Entanglement correlations are therefore fully compatible with relativistic
  causality.
  They do not depend on any privileged reference frame or global temporal ordering.
  Instead, they reflect non-factorizable admissible projected descriptions whose
  internal consistency is preserved under changes of effective spacetime slicing.

  In this sense, relativistic covariance is maintained because the physical content of
  the theory resides in relational consistency rather than in observer-dependent
  spatiotemporal labels.
  Temporal ordering remains an effective, observer-relative notion, while admissible
  correlations remain invariant across equivalent projected descriptions.
