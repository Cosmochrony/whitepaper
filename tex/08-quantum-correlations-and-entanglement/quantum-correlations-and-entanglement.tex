  \paragraph{Scope and strategy.}
    This section explains how quantum phenomenology can arise as an effective statistical description
    of the projection process itself.
    The key structural ingredient is the \emph{non-injective} character of the projection $\Pi$:
    distinct underlying $\chi$-configurations can correspond to the same effective observables,
    and a single underlying configuration may admit multiple effective images.
    We emphasize an \textbf{Ontological Monism} viewpoint: there is a single ontological source $\chi$,
    while apparent multiplicity and spatial separation are properties of the projected description.
    Within this setting, ``nonlocality'' does not require any signal transmission, because the correlated outcomes
    do not originate from independent ontological subsystems.
