\subsection{Summary}
  \label{subsec:summary8}

  Within the Cosmochrony framework, entanglement does not arise as a fundamental
  property of an underlying physical field.
  It emerges at the level of effective descriptions as the persistence of
  non-factorizable admissible projected configurations across interactions and
  spacetime separation.

  Quantum correlations therefore arise without superluminal signaling, fundamental
  wavefunction collapse, or violations of relativistic causality.
  They reflect the global consistency constraints of admissible projected
  descriptions, rather than any dynamical nonlocal influence.

  Within this perspective, quantum phenomena arise from the tension between global
  descriptive coherence and local projectability.
  The standard quantum-mechanical formalism emerges as an effective statistical
  framework encoding the probabilities of locally accessible reprojections once
  non-factorizable descriptions can no longer be jointly represented.

  In this sense, quantum mechanics is not a fundamental ontology but a consistent
  effective theory describing the limits of factorization and projectability of
  physical descriptions within spacetime.
