\subsection{Limits of Entanglement and Environmental Effects}
  \label{subsec:limits-of-entanglement}

  Entanglement is not a generic or permanent feature of admissible projected
  descriptions.
  It arises only within restricted regimes where a non-factorizable global description
  remains jointly projectable into spacetime.

  Interactions with an environment progressively restrict the set of admissible
  projected descriptions.
  As additional degrees of freedom become involved, global relational coherence ceases
  to be representable within a single effective description.
  The system then admits only factorized local projections, and entanglement is no
  longer accessible.

  As a result, entanglement is most robust for effectively isolated systems and becomes
  increasingly fragile in macroscopic or strongly interacting environments.
  This transition does not correspond to a physical degradation of an underlying
  substrate, but to a progressive loss of projectability of non-factorizable
  descriptions.

  In this sense, the emergence of classical behavior at large scales reflects a
  descriptive limitation rather than a fundamental quantum-to-classical transition.
  Classicality arises when only factorized projected descriptions remain admissible,
  without requiring any modification of the underlying relational structure.
