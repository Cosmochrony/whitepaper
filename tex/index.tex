\abstract{
  We propose \emph{Cosmochrony}, a foundational physical framework in which time, inertia,
  and spacetime geometry emerge from the irreversible relaxation of a single fundamental
  scalar field~$\chi$.
  Unlike conventional field theories defined on a pre-existing spacetime,
  Cosmochrony treats relaxation as the primary physical process, from which
  temporal ordering, effective metrics, and dynamical laws arise.

  Localized, long-lived excitations of the $\chi$ field appear as topologically
  and spectrally stable solitonic configurations.
  Their inertial mass is not postulated but emerges as a measure of resistance
  to global relaxation, quantified by the internal curvature and stability spectrum
  of the configuration.
  In regimes where an effective relativistic description applies, this interpretation
  naturally reproduces $E = mc^2$ as a kinematic identity rather than a fundamental axiom.
  Spin, statistics, and fermionic $4\pi$ periodicity originate from topological
  obstructions in the configuration space of $\chi$ excitations.

  An effective spacetime metric arises through coarse-grained projections of $\chi$
  relaxation dynamics, avoiding the assumption of a fundamental geometry.
  Gravitational and electromagnetic interactions are interpreted as manifestations
  of relaxation gradients and deformations of the underlying field, while gravitational
  waves correspond to propagating modulations of $\chi$.
  The Higgs mechanism is recovered as an effective low-energy description of how
  localized excitations acquire inertial properties within an already structured
  relaxation background, without modifying its empirical phenomenology.

  At cosmological scales, the framework provides a unified interpretation of cosmic
  expansion, dark matter, and dark energy in terms of the global relaxation budget
  of the $\chi$ field.
  The observed Hubble tension is addressed through nonlinear relaxation effects,
  without invoking new particle species or inflationary dynamics.

  Cosmochrony does not aim to replace the Standard Model or General Relativity at
  accessible energies, but to supply a deeper explanatory layer in which their
  structures emerge from a common physical origin.
  The framework yields testable qualitative predictions, identifies clear numerical
  programs for validation via lattice simulations, and delineates the conditions
  under which effective field theories and spacetime descriptions remain valid.
