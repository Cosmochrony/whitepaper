  \begin{abstract}

    We propose an exploratory geometric framework, termed Cosmochrony, in which spacetime dynamics,
    gravitation, and quantum phenomena emerge from the irreversible evolution of a single continuous
    scalar field $\chi$.
    The central hypothesis is that time corresponds to a monotonic geometric relaxation process of this field,
    while matter arises as stable, localized topological configurations (solitons) embedded within it.

    Within this setting, gravitation is interpreted as the collective resistance of localized excitations
    to the global relaxation of $\chi$, and quantum correlations emerge from shared field configurations
    without invoking fundamental nonlocality or wavefunction collapse.
    The standard quantum-mechanical
    formalism is recovered as an effective description of small fluctuations around solitonic backgrounds.
    Cosmological expansion and apparent acceleration follow naturally from the same relaxation dynamics,
    without introducing dark energy as an independent component.

    This work does not claim a complete or mathematically exhaustive unification, but rather outlines
    a minimal dynamical framework and examines its internal consistency and phenomenological implications.
    Several qualitative predictions are identified, including a geometric interpretation of the Hubble
    parameter and potential deviations from standard cosmological scenarios.
    The framework is intended as a research program and invites further mathematical development and empirical scrutiny.

  \section{Conclusion and Outlook}\label{sec:conclusion-and-outlook}

    We have presented cosmochrony, a minimalist framework in which a single continuous scalar field, $\chi$,
    underlies the emergence of spacetime, gravity, quantum phenomena, and cosmological evolution.

    In this approach, spacetime expansion arises from the monotonic relaxation of $\chi$,
    gravity emerges as a collective slowdown induced by localized excitations, and particles correspond to stable
    topological configurations of the field.
    Radiation and quantization appear during interactions rather than as fundamental postulates, while quantum
    correlations reflect persistent connectivity within $\chi$.

    Cosmochrony reproduces the phenomenology of general relativity, quantum mechanics, and standard cosmology in their
    respective regimes, while offering a unified interpretation based on fewer assumptions.
    Key cosmological observations, including the Hubble law, apparent cosmic acceleration, the cosmic microwave
    background, and the arrow of time, emerge naturally from the same underlying dynamics.

    Several aspects of the theory remain open.
    A fully covariant action principle for $\chi$, a rigorous mathematical classification of particle-like excitations,
    and detailed numerical simulations of $\chi$ dynamics are needed to strengthen the formal foundation.
    Future observational tests, particularly in precision cosmology and gravitational wave astronomy, may provide
    opportunities to distinguish cosmochrony from conventional frameworks.

    By reducing the number of fundamental ingredients while preserving empirical adequacy, cosmochrony offers a
    promising avenue toward a unified description of physical phenomena.
