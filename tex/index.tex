\abstract{
  We present \emph{Cosmochrony}, a minimalist geometric framework in which time, spacetime structure, gravitation,
  and quantum phenomena emerge from the irreversible relaxation of a single continuous scalar quantity, denoted $\chi$.
  The field $\chi$ is not defined on a pre-existing spacetime manifold; rather, it constitutes a
  pre-geometric substrate whose monotonic relaxation provides an intrinsic ordering of physical
  processes, identified with physical time.
  This irreversibility is interpreted energetically, with energy understood as the residual capacity of $\chi$
  configurations to relax, while spatial relations arise relationally from gradients and correlations within the field.

  Within this framework, matter is described as stable, localized topological configurations of $\chi$.
  Gravitation emerges as a collective effect of these excitations locally constraining the relaxation
  of the field, leading to gravitational time dilation and effective spacetime curvature without
  postulating a fundamental metric or gravitational interaction.

  Quantum phenomena are interpreted as effective descriptions of coherent fluctuations around
  solitonic configurations of $\chi$.
  Entanglement reflects the persistence of shared field configurations across spatial separation,
  yielding nonlocal correlations without superluminal signaling, local hidden variables, or
  fundamental wavefunction collapse.

  The standard formalisms of general relativity and quantum mechanics are not assumed at the
  fundamental level but are recovered as emergent, coarse-grained descriptions valid in regimes
  where $\chi$ admits a stable geometric interpretation.
  Cosmological expansion follows directly from the global relaxation of $\chi$, leading to a
  geometric interpretation of the Hubble parameter and an apparent acceleration without invoking
  dark energy or an inflationary phase.

  While not proposed as a final unified theory, Cosmochrony offers a conceptually coherent
  framework that clarifies the physical origin of time, geometry, gravitation, and quantum
  correlations within a single scalar dynamics.
  The approach identifies qualitative and semi-quantitative signatures that may allow empirical
  distinction from standard cosmological scenarios and provides a basis for further foundational
  and mathematical investigation.
