\subsection{Relation to Conventional Fields}
  \label{subsec:relation-to-conventional-fields}

  Although effective descriptions derived from projected $\chi$ configurations may
  exhibit formal similarities with scalar fields employed in cosmology (such as
  inflaton-like fields), the ontological role of $\chi$ is fundamentally different.
  The $\chi$ substrate is not a physical field propagating on spacetime, but a
  pre-geometric relational structure from which spacetime notions themselves emerge.

  Accordingly, $\chi$ does not carry energy in the conventional field-theoretic sense,
  nor is it subject to quantization at the fundamental level.
  Quantization arises only at the effective level, where certain stable and localized
  configurations of the $\chi$ substrate admit a particle-like interpretation and can
  be consistently described using standard quantum field-theoretic tools within an
  emergent spacetime regime.

  Within this framework, matter, radiation, and interactions do not correspond to
  independent fields coupled to $\chi$.
  They arise instead as effective manifestations of constraints, topological features,
  or long-lived relational patterns of projected $\chi$ configurations.
  Conventional fields of the Standard Model are thus recovered as effective
  descriptions of these emergent degrees of freedom in regimes where a spacetime
  interpretation appl
