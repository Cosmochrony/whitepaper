\subsection{Definition of the $\chi$ Field}
  \label{subsec:definition-of-the-chi-field}

  We postulate the existence of a single pre-geometric relational substrate, denoted $\chi$,
  which constitutes the primitive substrate of physical reality.
  The quantity $\chi$ is not defined on a pre-existing spacetime manifold and does not
  presuppose any metric, causal, or geometric structure.
  Instead, spacetime notions arise only as effective descriptions of the relational
  and dynamical properties of $\chi$ configurations.

  Ontologically, $\chi$ is not a scalar order parameter and does not possess values.
  Scalar order parameters arise only at the effective level, as coarse-grained descriptors of projected $\chi$
  configurations once a geometric regime is established.
  Dimensional quantities associated with length or time arise only at the effective level, once $\chi$
  configurations admit a geometric interpretation.
  The monotonic ordering intrinsic to $\chi$
  configurations gives rise, upon projection, to what is operationally perceived
  as temporal flow.

  Temporal ordering emerges from the global, monotonic ordering intrinsic to $\chi$ configurations across physical
  processes, establishing an intrinsic arrow of time without reference to an external temporal coordinate.
  Spatial separation, in turn, arises from relational differences between $\chi$
  configurations, giving rise to an effective notion of distance once a stable geometric
  regime is established.
  In this sense, time corresponds to ordering, while space corresponds to relational
  structure.

  At no stage is $\chi$ interpreted as a spacetime coordinate or as a material field
  propagating on spacetime.
  Spacetime coordinates and metric structure appear only as secondary, coarse-grained
  constructs, becoming meaningful when $\chi$ configurations admit a quasi-stable
  geometric interpretation.
  The spacetime metric thus functions as an emergent, effective descriptor of resistance
  to $\chi$ relaxation\footnote{The term ``relaxation'' is used here in a geometric and
  dynamical sense, and should not be confused with thermodynamic relaxation processes
  involving dissipation or entropy increase.} and of the propagation of perturbations
  within the field.

  The analogy with thermodynamic order parameters applies only at the effective level: $\chi$ itself is not an order
  parameter, but gives rise to effective order parameters once projected.
  In the Cosmochrony framework, $\chi$ therefore provides the minimal ontological basis
  from which time, space, gravitation, and quantum phenomena jointly emerge.

  In the following sections, spacetime coordinates and metric quantities will be
  introduced strictly as effective tools, valid in regimes where $\chi$ admits a stable
  geometric interpretation.

  \paragraph{On the use of spacetime language.}
    Throughout this work, phrases such as ``spacetime coordinates,'' ``metric tensor,'' and ``four-dimensional
    manifold'' appear frequently, for the sake of clarity and effective description.
    These should be understood as \emph{emergent effective descriptions} valid in regimes where $\chi$
    has relaxed into a quasi-stable geometric configuration.
    They are not fundamental ingredients of the theory.

    At the deepest level, only $\chi$ and its internal relational variation structure exist.
    The appearance of familiar geometric language reflects the effectiveness of spacetime as a coarse-grained
    description of collective $\chi$
    behavior, analogous to how thermodynamic variables (temperature, pressure) emerge from molecular dynamics
    without those variables being fundamental.

    This interpretational stance is essential for distinguishing Cosmochrony from approaches that merely reformulate
    existing geometric theories in different variables.
