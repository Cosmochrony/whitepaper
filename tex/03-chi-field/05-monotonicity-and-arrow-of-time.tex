\subsection{Monotonicity and Arrow of Time}
  \label{subsec:monotonicity-and-arrow-of-time}

  A central structural postulate of Cosmochrony is that the relational substrate $\chi$
  admits an intrinsic, globally ordered relaxation structure.
  In effective descriptions, this ordering manifests as the monotonic behavior of the
  projected scalar descriptor $\chi_{\mathrm{eff}}$ along admissible ordering paths:
  \begin{equation}
    \mathcal{D}_{\lambda} \chi_{\mathrm{eff}} \ge 0 .
  \end{equation}
  Here $\lambda$ denotes an ordering parameter associated with the relaxation of
  projected $\chi$ configurations, rather than a fundamental time coordinate.
  The inequality expresses a structural constraint on admissible projected
  representations, not an evolution equation for a fundamental scalar quantity.

  This monotonicity reflects an intrinsic asymmetry in the ordering structure of $\chi$
  configurations.
  Because the projection from $\chi$ to $\chi_{\mathrm{eff}}$ is generically
  non-injective, admissible effective descriptions may lose information about
  underlying configurations, but cannot exhibit reversals of the ordering induced by
  relaxation.

  Within this framework, energy is interpreted as an effective measure of the
  remaining capacity of projected $\chi$ configurations to undergo further
  relaxation.
  As relaxation proceeds, this capacity is irreversibly expended in the projected
  description.
  Admissible ordering paths therefore exclude any effective decrease of
  $\chi_{\mathrm{eff}}$, which would correspond to a restoration of relaxation capacity
  incompatible with the underlying ordering structure.

  Irreversibility follows directly from this structural constraint.
  The arrow of time is identified with the directional ordering induced by relaxation:
  the progression from configurations with greater effective relaxation capacity
  toward configurations in which that capacity has been locally or globally exhausted.

  This temporal orientation is not derived from coarse-graining, entropy production,
  or special initial conditions.
  It arises prior to any statistical or thermodynamic description, as a direct
  consequence of the ordering constraints imposed by $\chi$ on its admissible
  projections.
  The relation to thermodynamic irreversibility is discussed further in
  Section~\ref{subsec:entropy-arrow}.
