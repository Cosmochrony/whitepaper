\section{Definition and Fundamental Properties of the $\chi$ Substrate}
  \label{sec:definition-and-fundamental-properties-of-the-chi-field}

  Having outlined the ontological and conceptual principles underlying Cosmochrony, we now
  introduce the fundamental quantity at the core of the framework.
  This section is devoted to defining the pre-geometric substrate $\chi$ and clarifying its role as a
  pre-geometric substrate from which effective notions of spacetime, dynamics, and physical
  observables may emerge.

  The purpose of this section is not to assume a pre-existing spacetime structure, but to
  identify the minimal properties required of $\chi$ in order to recover, in appropriate
  regimes, effective descriptions of time, space, metric geometry, and field dynamics.
  Accordingly, $\chi$ is introduced independently of any spacetime coordinates or metric
  structure, and only later related to geometric notions once a stable spacetime interpretation
  becomes meaningful.

  Throughout this section, the use of variational principles, Lagrangian formulations, or
  metric-based expressions does not imply that spacetime or a four-dimensional manifold is
  fundamental.
  Such formalisms are employed strictly as effective, coarse-grained tools to describe the
  dynamics of $\chi$ in regimes where its configurations admit a geometric interpretation.
  They should be understood as descriptive representations of the underlying pre-geometric
  dynamics, not as primary postulates of the theory.

  We begin by providing a unified conceptual definition of the $\chi$ substrate and its physical
  interpretation.
  The subsequent subsections introduce progressively more structured effective descriptions,
  including Lagrangian and metric formulations, which become applicable only once the
  underlying $\chi$ configurations support a stable spacetime regime.
