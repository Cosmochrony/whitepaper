\subsection{Monotonicity and Arrow of Time}
  \label{subsec:monotonicity-and-arrow-of-time}

  A central structural assumption of Cosmochrony is that the relational substrate $\chi$
  admits an intrinsic, globally ordered relaxation structure.
  This ordering is reflected, within effective descriptions, by the monotonic behavior
  of the projected scalar descriptor $\chi_{\mathrm{eff}}$ along admissible physical
  processes:
  \begin{equation}
    \mathcal{D}_{\lambda} \chi_{\mathrm{eff}} \ge 0 .
  \end{equation}
  Here $\lambda$ denotes an ordering parameter associated with the relaxation of
  projected $\chi$ configurations, not a fundamental time coordinate.
  The inequality expresses a structural constraint on admissible projected descriptions,
  rather than the evolution of a fundamental scalar quantity.

  This monotonicity is not introduced as a statistical statement, nor as a boundary
  condition imposed on an otherwise time-symmetric dynamics.
  Rather, it reflects an intrinsic asymmetry in the ordering structure of $\chi$
  configurations, which constrains the form of all effective descriptions compatible
  with the framework.

  Within this perspective, energy is not treated as a fundamental conserved substance,
  but as an effective measure of the remaining capacity of projected $\chi$
  configurations to undergo further relaxation.
  As effective relaxation proceeds, this capacity is irreversibly expended.
  A hypothetical decrease of $\chi_{\mathrm{eff}}$ along an admissible ordering path
  would correspond to a spontaneous restoration of relaxation capacity, effectively
  reintroducing contraction or tension into the projected description.
  No mechanism within Cosmochrony allows such a reversal, as it would contradict the
  underlying ordering structure of $\chi$.

  Irreversibility therefore follows directly from the structure of the relaxation
  ordering admitted by $\chi$.
  Because admissible projected descriptions cannot exhibit decreasing
  $\chi_{\mathrm{eff}}$, the ordering of configurations induced by relaxation is
  intrinsically directed.
  What is conventionally described as the arrow of time is identified here with this
  directional ordering: the irreversible progression from configurations with greater
  effective relaxation capacity toward configurations in which that capacity has been
  exhausted.

  Importantly, this arrow is not derived from coarse-graining, probabilistic entropy,
  or special initial conditions.
  It arises prior to any statistical or thermodynamic description, as a direct
  consequence of the structural ordering constraints imposed by $\chi$ on its
  projected representations.
  Temporal orientation is thus a manifestation of the fundamental ordering structure,
  rather than an emergent asymmetry imposed at the macroscopic level.
