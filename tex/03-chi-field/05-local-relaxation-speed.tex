\subsection{Local Relaxation Speed}
  \label{subsec:local-relaxation-speed}

  A fundamental structural constraint of the Cosmochrony framework is that the effective
  local ordering rate associated with projected $\chi$ configurations is bounded by a
  universal constant:
  \begin{equation}
    \left| \mathcal{D}_{\mathrm{loc}} \chi_{\mathrm{eff}} \right| \le c ,
  \end{equation}
  where $\mathcal{D}_{\mathrm{loc}} \chi_{\mathrm{eff}}$ denotes an effective local
  relaxation functional characterizing the maximal admissible ordering of projected
  $\chi$ configurations within the emergent geometric description.
  The parameter $c$ coincides numerically with the observed speed of light.

  This bound does not represent the propagation speed of particles, fields, or signals,
  nor does it presuppose a pre-existing spacetime structure.
  Rather, it constrains the maximal rate at which effective causal relations and geometric
  structure can locally emerge within projected descriptions compatible with the
  underlying ordering structure of $\chi$.

  Superluminal recession velocities at cosmological scales arise naturally through
  cumulative and global effects of projected $\chi$ ordering, and do not violate local
  causality.
  Local causal relations remain bounded by the constraint $c$, which applies exclusively
  to effective descriptions and not to the fundamental $\chi$ substrate itself.
