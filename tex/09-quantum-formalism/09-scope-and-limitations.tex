\subsection{Scope and Limitations}
  \label{subsec:scope-and-limitations}

  Cosmochrony does not aim to replace quantum mechanics as a predictive or
  computational framework.
  All standard quantum-mechanical formalisms, including operator methods, path
  integrals, and perturbative techniques, remain valid and unchanged within their
  established domains of applicability.

  The contribution of Cosmochrony is interpretative and unificatory.
  It provides a coherent pre-geometric and relational origin for quantum phenomena,
  clarifying the ontological status of the wavefunction, quantization, measurement,
  and nonlocal correlations, without altering any experimentally verified
  predictions.

  In this framework, quantum mechanics is understood as an effective theory
  governing admissible projected descriptions in regimes where linearity,
  localization, and factorization hold approximately.
  Cosmochrony does not introduce new degrees of freedom, hidden variables, or
  modifications of quantum dynamics.

  A complete formal correspondence between the relational $\chi$ substrate and the
  operator-based structures of quantum theory, including a systematic derivation of
  Hilbert space, observables, and evolution operators, lies beyond the scope of the
  present work and is left for future investigation.

  Accordingly, the present framework should be regarded as a foundational
  reconstruction rather than a competing physical theory, intended to clarify the
  conceptual origin and domain of validity of quantum-mechanical descriptions.
