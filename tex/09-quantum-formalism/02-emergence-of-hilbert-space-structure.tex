\subsection{Emergence of Hilbert Space Structure}
  \label{subsec:emergence-of-hilbert-space-structure}

  The Hilbert space formalism of quantum mechanics provides a linear structure
  supporting superposition, interference, and unitary evolution.
  Within the Cosmochrony framework, this structure does not reflect a fundamental
  property of an underlying physical substrate.
  It emerges as an effective mathematical organization of admissible projected
  descriptions in regimes where relational constraints are weak and approximately
  factorizable.

  In such regimes, distinct admissible projected descriptions can be combined without
  significant mutual constraint, giving rise to an approximate linear structure.
  Superposition reflects the coexistence of multiple compatible descriptive
  alternatives, rather than the simultaneous physical realization of multiple states.

  The inner-product structure of Hilbert space encodes the degree of mutual
  compatibility between projected descriptions.
  Orthogonality corresponds to mutually exclusive descriptive regimes, while
  non-orthogonal states represent partially compatible projections whose distinctions
  cannot be jointly resolved.

  The complex phase of the wavefunction does not correspond to an intrinsic oscillatory
  structure of a physical field.
  It encodes relational consistency conditions between alternative projected
  descriptions, ensuring coherent interference patterns within effective spacetime
  representations.

  Unitary evolution arises as a consistency-preserving transformation within the space
  of admissible projected descriptions, valid so long as projectability and
  factorizability remain approximately intact.
  When these conditions fail, such as during measurement or strong environmental
  coupling, the Hilbert space description ceases to be adequate, and non-unitary
  effective behavior emerges.

  In this perspective, Hilbert space is not a fundamental arena of physical reality.
  It is the natural mathematical structure organizing the space of admissible
  descriptions in regimes where linearity and coherence provide accurate effective
  approximations.
