\section{Relation to Quantum Formalism}
  \label{sec:relation-to-quantum-formalism}

  This section does not assign fundamental ontological status to the quantum
  wavefunction, Hilbert space, or operator structures.
  Instead, it shows how the formal apparatus of quantum mechanics arises as an
  effective and internally consistent description organizing admissible projected
  descriptions in regimes where localization, linearity, and approximate
  factorization hold.

  Within the Cosmochrony framework, quantum mechanics is not derived from an
  underlying microscopic dynamics of the $\chi$ substrate.
  Rather, it emerges as a universal coarse-grained formalism governing the
  projectability and temporal consistency of localized physical descriptions once a
  stable geometric interpretation becomes applicable.

  Quantum mechanics is therefore not replaced, but reinterpreted as an effective
  framework whose validity is restricted to regimes where the relational structure
  of $\chi$ admits a stable, approximately linear, spacetime-based description.
  The following subsections clarify the origin and interpretational status of the
  wavefunction, Hilbert space structure, quantization, measurement, entanglement,
  and related quantum concepts within this perspective.
