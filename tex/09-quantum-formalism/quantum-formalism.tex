\section{Relation to Quantum Formalism}
  \label{sec:relation-to-quantum-formalism}

  This section does not assign fundamental ontological status to the quantum
  wavefunction, Hilbert space, or operator-based structures.
  Instead, it shows how the formal apparatus of quantum mechanics arises as an
  effective and internally consistent framework organizing admissible projected
  descriptions in regimes where localization, linearity, and approximate
  factorization hold.

  Within the Cosmochrony framework, quantum mechanics is not derived as a direct
  quantization of an underlying microscopic dynamics of the $\chi$ substrate.
  Rather, it emerges as a universal coarse-grained formalism governing the
  projectability, stability, and temporal consistency of localized projected
  descriptions once a stable geometric interpretation becomes applicable.

  Quantum mechanics is therefore not replaced, but reinterpreted as an effective
  theory whose validity is restricted to regimes in which the relational structure
  of $\chi$ admits a stable, approximately linear, spacetime-based description.
  Outside these regimes, the Hilbert-space formalism ceases to provide an adequate
  representation, while the underlying relational dynamics of $\chi$ remain
  well-defined.

  The following subsections clarify the origin and interpretational status of the
  wavefunction, the emergence of Hilbert space structure, the effective nature of
  the Schr\"odinger equation, the structural origin of quantization, the role of
  measurement and the Born rule, the interpretation of entanglement and nonlocal
  correlations, the topological origin of spin and statistics, and the meaning of
  orbital geometry within this perspective.
