\subsection{Emergence of the Schr\"odinger Equation as an Effective Description}
  \label{sec:schrodinger_emergence}

  Within the Cosmochrony framework, quantum dynamics is not postulated as a fundamental
  law.
  The Schr\"odinger equation arises as an effective, long-wavelength and
  non-relativistic description organizing admissible projected descriptions in regimes
  where localization, approximate factorization, and temporal projectability are
  simultaneously valid.

  Rather than emerging from physical fluctuations of an underlying field, the
  Schr\"odinger equation appears as the universal consistency condition governing the
  time evolution of localized projected descriptions whose internal structure remains
  approximately stationary.

  \subsubsection*{Formal Non-Relativistic Limit}
    \label{sec:KGtoSch}

    In regimes where an effective relativistic description applies, admissible projected
    descriptions of localized configurations admit a second-order hyperbolic evolution
    equation whose formal structure coincides with the Klein--Gordon equation.
    This equation should be understood as an effective geometric encoding of stability
    and admissibility conditions, not as a fundamental field equation.

    In the non-relativistic regime, the effective description separates naturally into a
    rapidly varying phase associated with rest-energy and a slowly varying envelope
    describing spatial localization.
    Formally, this separation may be written as
    \begin{equation}
      \Psi(x,t) = \psi(x,t)\, e^{-i \omega_0 t},
      \qquad \omega_0 = \frac{mc^2}{\hbar},
    \end{equation}
    where $\Psi$ denotes an effective relativistic descriptive field and $\psi$ its
    non-relativistic envelope.

    Imposing the condition that the envelope varies slowly compared to the rest-energy
    scale leads, to leading order, to the Schr\"odinger equation,
    \begin{equation}
      i\hbar\,\partial_t \psi
      = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\nabla^2 \psi + V(x)\psi,
      \label{eq:Sch_V}
    \end{equation}
    where $V(x)$ encodes weak external constraints on admissible projected descriptions,
    such as background gravitational or electromagnetic effects.

    \paragraph{Interpretation.}
      The wavefunction $\psi$ does not represent a physical excitation or fluctuation of an
      underlying substrate.
      It is a derived mathematical object encoding the admissible time evolution of
      localized projected descriptions once a non-relativistic spacetime interpretation
      becomes applicable.

      In this sense, the Schr\"odinger equation is not a fundamental dynamical law.
      It is the effective evolution equation governing admissible projected descriptions in
      regimes where linearity, localization, and approximate factorization provide accurate
      descriptive approximations.
