\subsection{Equivalence Principle}
  \label{subsec:equivalence-principle}

  Because all particle-like excitations couple to the $\chi$ field through the same
  relaxation mechanism, the collective slowdown of $\chi$ is independent of the
  internal composition or structure of matter.
  As a result, all localized excitations respond identically to a given
  configuration of the $\chi$ field.

  When described in effective geometric terms, this universal response appears as
  composition-independent gravitational acceleration.
  The equivalence between inertial and gravitational behavior therefore emerges as
  a consequence of the uniform coupling of matter to the relaxation dynamics of
  $\chi$, rather than as an independent postulate.

  In this sense, the equivalence principle arises naturally within Cosmochrony as an
  emergent symmetry of the underlying dynamics.
