\subsection{Emergent Curvature}
  \label{subsec:emergent-curvature}

  Spatial variations in admissible relaxation ordering, together with the collective
  modulation of effective coupling strength, lead to non-uniform correlation patterns
  within projected descriptions.
  When expressed in an effective geometric language, these non-uniformities are
  summarized by gradients of an emergent metric structure.

  In this sense, spacetime curvature in Cosmochrony is not a primitive geometric
  property.
  It is a descriptive construct encoding how localized projected configurations
  collectively modulate admissible ordering and correlation structure across extended
  regions.
  The metric does not act as an independent dynamical agent, but serves as a compact
  representation of constrained relational organization within effective
  descriptions.

  This emergent curvature reproduces the phenomenology traditionally attributed to
  curved spacetime in general relativity, including gravitational time dilation,
  geodesic deviation, and lensing effects.
  At the same time, it remains fully compatible with the pre-geometric and relational
  foundations of the framework, in which geometry arises only as an effective and
  operational notion.
