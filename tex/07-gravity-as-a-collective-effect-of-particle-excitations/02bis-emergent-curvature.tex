\subsection{Emergent Curvature}
  \label{subsec:emergent-curvature}

  Spatial variations in the effective relaxation rate of $\chi$, together with the
  collective modulation of local coupling strength, lead to non-uniform propagation
  of $\chi$ variations across extended regions.
  When described using an effective geometric language, these non-uniformities are
  captured by gradients of an emergent metric structure.

  In this sense, spacetime curvature in Cosmochrony is not a primitive geometric
  property, but a descriptive tool summarizing how localized excitations collectively
  modulate the relaxation and transmission of $\chi$.
  The metric curvature encodes the response of the $\chi$ field to such constraints,
  rather than acting as an independent dynamical agent.

  This emergent curvature reproduces the phenomenology traditionally attributed to
  curved spacetime in general relativity, while remaining fully compatible with the
  pre-geometric and relational foundations of the framework.
