\subsection{Summary}
  \label{subsec:summary6}

  Within the Cosmochrony framework, gravity does not arise as a fundamental interaction
  or as an independent geometric degree of freedom.
  It emerges at the level of effective descriptions as a macroscopic consequence of
  localized projected configurations collectively constraining admissible relaxation
  ordering.

  Classical gravitational phenomena—including gravitational time dilation, effective
  spacetime curvature, gravitational waves, and black holes—are recovered as distinct
  descriptive regimes of this collective constraint.
  They reflect variations in the projectability and correlation structure of admissible
  descriptions, rather than the dynamics of a fundamental spacetime or gravitational
  field.

  In this perspective, gravitation appears as an emergent, operational phenomenon,
  summarizing how localized projected configurations collectively limit admissible
  ordering and correlation across extended regions, without introducing gravity as a
  primitive force or fundamental geometric entity.
