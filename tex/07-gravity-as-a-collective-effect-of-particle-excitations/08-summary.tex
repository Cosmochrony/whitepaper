\subsection{Summary}
  \label{subsec:summary6}

  Gravity emerges as a macroscopic consequence of localized particle excitations
  collectively slowing the relaxation of the $\chi$ field.
  Classical gravitational phenomena, including time dilation, effective spacetime
  curvature, gravitational waves, and black holes, arise naturally within this
  framework without introducing gravity as a fundamental force or independent
  geometric degree of freedom.
