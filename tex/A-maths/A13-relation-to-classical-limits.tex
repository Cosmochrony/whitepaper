\subsection{Relation to Classical Limits}
  \label{subsec:relation-to-classical-limits}

  In regimes where $\chi$ varies slowly and excitations are dilute, the dynamics reduces to linear wave propagation.
  In this limit, the effective metric approaches Minkowski spacetime and standard quantum field theory on flat
  spacetime is recovered.

  Conversely, in high-density regimes, strong gradients in $\chi$ reproduce the phenomenology of curved spacetime and
  gravitational collapse.
