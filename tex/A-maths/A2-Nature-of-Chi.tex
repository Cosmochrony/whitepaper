The field $\chi(x^\mu)$ is postulated as a real scalar field defined on a four-dimensional differentiable manifold.
Unlike conventional scalar fields in quantum field theory, $\chi$ does not represent a matter degree of freedom propagating
\emph{within} spacetime.
Instead, it encodes the local geometric scale governing the emergence of spacetime itself.

Operationally, $\chi$ may be interpreted as a proper wavelength field whose monotonic increase defines both spatial
separation and temporal flow.
