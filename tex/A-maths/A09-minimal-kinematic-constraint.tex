\subsection{Minimal Kinematic Constraint}
  \label{subsec:minimal-kinematic-constraint}

  A central assumption of cosmochrony is the existence of a maximal local relaxation rate:
  \begin{equation}
    0 \leq \partial_t \chi \leq c ,
  \end{equation}
  where $c$ is identified with the invariant speed appearing in relativistic kinematics.

  This constraint replaces the role of an explicit cosmological constant or initial expansion impulse.
  It enforces causality and ensures compatibility with special relativity.
