\subsection{Status of the Formulation}
  \label{subsec:status-of-the-formulation}

  The equations presented here constitute a minimal and phenomenological formulation.
  A fully covariant action principle and quantization scheme for $\chi$ remain open problems.

  Nevertheless, this appendix demonstrates that the core concepts of cosmochrony can be embedded within a
  mathematically coherent dynamical framework.
