\subsection{Cosmic Microwave Background Scale}
    \label{subsec:cosmic-microwave-background-scale}

  At recombination ($z_{\mathrm{rec}} \simeq 1100$), the characteristic scale of $\chi$
  was smaller by the same factor:
  \begin{equation}
    \chi(t_{\mathrm{rec}}) \simeq \frac{\chi(t_0)}{1 + z_{\mathrm{rec}}}.
  \end{equation}

  Fluctuations imprinted at that epoch are stretched by subsequent $\chi$
  growth, explaining the observed angular power spectrum of the CMB\@.
