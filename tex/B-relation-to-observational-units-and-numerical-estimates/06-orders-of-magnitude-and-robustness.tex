\subsection{Orders of Magnitude and Robustness}
    \label{subsec:orders-of-magnitude-and-robustness}

  All numerical estimates presented here rely solely on observed cosmological quantities and the assumption of
  bounded $\chi$ relaxation.
  No fine-tuning of parameters is required.

  While precise numerical modeling remains to be developed, these estimates demonstrate that cosmochrony naturally
  reproduces the correct orders of magnitude for key cosmological observables.
