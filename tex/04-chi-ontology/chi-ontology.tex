\section{Ontological Interpretation of the $\chi$ Substrate}
  \label{sec:chi_ontology}

  Having established the minimal structural properties and effective dynamical
  descriptions of the $\chi$ substrate, we now turn to its ontological interpretation.
  The purpose of this section is not to introduce new formal structures, but to clarify
  the status of the entities, quantities, and asymmetries that emerge within the
  Cosmochrony framework.

  Throughout this section, we explicitly distinguish between the pre-temporal,
  pre-geometric substrate $\chi$ and its effective spacetime projections.
  In particular, we carefully separate invariant structural constraints defined at the
  level of $\chi$ from their emergent manifestations within spacetime-based physical
  descriptions.
  This distinction is essential for avoiding dual ontologies and for maintaining a
  coherent hierarchy between fundamental structure and effective representation.

  A recurring theme is the ontological asymmetry introduced by projection.
  While all physical observables, spacetime notions, and dynamical laws arise only after
  projection from $\chi$, the relational structure of $\chi$ itself does not admit a
  reformulation entirely in spacetime or field-theoretic terms.
  The projected universe is therefore physically real but ontologically derivative.

  In this context, we emphasize the distinction between the invariant structural bound
  $c_{\chi}$, defined at the level of the pre-temporal substrate, and its effective
  spacetime manifestation $c$.
  The latter acquires operational meaning only once notions such as distance, duration,
  and causal propagation become meaningful within projected descriptions.
  This separation underlies the emergence of relativistic causality without postulating
  spacetime as fundamental~\cite{Rovelli2018}.

  The subsections that follow articulate the ontological consequences of this framework.
  We examine the status of $\chi$ as a pre-temporal structural plan, its relation to
  relational and holographic approaches, the origin of indeterminacy and apparent
  randomness, and the reinterpretation of energy, mass, and confinement as emergent
  features of projection.
  We also clarify the ontological role of universal constants such as $c$ and $\hbar$,
  showing how they arise as projective manifestations of deeper structural constraints.

  Together, these considerations aim to provide a coherent ontological reading of
  Cosmochrony, in which time, matter, causality, and quantum phenomena emerge from a
  single pre-geometric relational substrate without invoking additional fundamental
  entities or postulates.
