\subsection{Scope and Limitations}
  \label{subsec:context-and-motivation-scope-and-limitations}

  The aim of this work is exploratory rather than definitive.
  Cosmochrony does not seek to replace established theories within their empirically
  validated domains, but to offer a coherent reinterpretation that may clarify
  persistent conceptual difficulties concerning time, geometry, and quantization.

  Throughout the paper, emphasis is placed on internal consistency, conceptual clarity,
  and qualitative contact with observable phenomena, while openly acknowledging open questions and limitations.
  In the following section, we introduce the $\chi$ substrate formally and specify the
  minimal assumptions underlying its relational and dynamical structure.
