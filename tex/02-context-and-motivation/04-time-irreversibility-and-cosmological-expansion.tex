\subsection{Time, Irreversibility, and Cosmological Expansion}
  \label{subsec:time-irreversibility-and-cosmological-expansion}

  A central motivation for the Cosmochrony framework is the close connection between
  time, irreversibility, and cosmological expansion.
  In standard cosmology, expansion is described kinematically through the scale factor,
  while the arrow of time is typically attributed to boundary conditions or entropy
  growth~\cite{peebles1993principles,Prigogine1997,penrose1989emperors}.

  In Cosmochrony, the monotonic relaxation of $\chi$ provides a unified origin for both phenomena.
  Irreversibility follows directly from the intrinsic directionality of the relaxation
  process, while cosmological expansion is interpreted as its large-scale geometric
  manifestation in the effective, projected description.
  From this perspective, expansion does not require an externally imposed energy
  component, but arises as an emergent consequence of the underlying pre-geometric dynamics.
