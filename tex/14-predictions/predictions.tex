\section{Testable Predictions and Observational Signatures}
  \label{sec:testable-predictions-and-observational-signatures}

  Before detailing specific observational signatures, it is useful to emphasize the
  general origin of the phenomenology predicted by the Cosmochrony framework.
  The monotonic relaxation of the $\chi$ substrate, together with the topological
  organization of localized projectable configurations, generically leads to a set of
  qualitative and semi-quantitative signatures that distinguish Cosmochrony from
  standard cosmological and quantum approaches.

  It is therefore important to clarify the epistemic status of the numerical estimates
  presented in this section.
  Values such as the $\sim 8$--$10\%$ offset between early- and late-time effective
  determinations of the Hubble constant or the $\sim 10^{-10}\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ drift in
  effective spacetime observables are not proposed as precision predictions.
  They should be understood as order-of-magnitude consistency estimates derived from
  the geometric coupling between the $\chi$ substrate and the effective relaxation
  fraction $\Omega_\chi$.

  Their role is to demonstrate that the Cosmochrony framework operates within a
  phenomenologically relevant regime, capable of addressing current observational
  tensions without fine-tuning or the introduction of additional dynamical degrees
  of freedom.
