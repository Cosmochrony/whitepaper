\subsection{Particles as Stable Wave Configurations}
  \label{subsec:particles-as-stable-wave-configurations}

  Within the Cosmochrony framework, particles are not fundamental point-like objects
  but stable, localized excitations of the $\chi$ field~\cite{Rajaraman1982}.
  They correspond to persistent wave configurations that locally constrain the
  relaxation of $\chi$.

  These configurations may be interpreted as soliton-like structures: they preserve
  their identity under interactions and effective displacement, while remaining
  fully embedded in the underlying relaxation dynamics of $\chi$.
  Their apparent propagation reflects the continuous reconfiguration of the
  $\chi$ field rather than motion through a pre-existing spacetime background.
