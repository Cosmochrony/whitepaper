\subsection{Particles as Stable Wave Configurations}
  \label{subsec:particles-as-stable-wave-configurations}

  Within the Cosmochrony framework, particles are not fundamental point-like objects.
  They arise only at the level of effective descriptions, as stable and localized
  configurations within projected $\chi$ descriptions.
  These configurations correspond to persistent patterns that locally constrain the
  admissible relaxation ordering, rather than to elementary entities propagating on a
  pre-existing spacetime background.

  In effective geometric regimes, such structures may be described using a wave-like
  or soliton-like language.
  They preserve their identity under interactions and effective displacement, while
  remaining entirely embedded in the constrained ordering of projected $\chi$
  configurations.
  Their apparent propagation reflects a continuous reconfiguration of admissible
  projected descriptions, not the motion of an object through a fundamental spacetime.

  In this sense, particle-like behavior does not originate from intrinsic degrees of
  freedom of the $\chi$ substrate.
  It emerges instead as a stable invariant of the effective relational structure once
  a spacetime interpretation becomes meaningful.
