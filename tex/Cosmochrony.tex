\abstract{
  We propose \emph{Cosmochrony}, a foundational physical framework in which time, inertia,
  and spacetime geometry emerge from the irreversible relaxation of a single fundamental
  entity $\chi$. Unlike conventional field theories defined on a pre-existing spacetime,
  Cosmochrony treats relaxation as the primary physical process from which temporal
  ordering, effective metrics, and dynamical laws are derived \emph{ab initio}.

  Localized, long-lived excitations of the $\chi$ substrate appear as topologically
  and spectrally stable solitonic configurations. Fermionic properties arise from
  topological obstructions in the configuration space of $\chi$, while inertial mass
  is not postulated but emerges as resistance to global relaxation, quantified by the
  stability spectrum of the configuration. By resolving the circularity between
  configuration and distance through spectral graph methods, the effective metric
  becomes an emergent property. This interpretation naturally recovers $E = mc^2$
  as a kinematic identity, while spin, statistics, and fermionic $4\pi$ periodicity
  follow from the nontrivial topology of projected configurations.

  The Standard Model phenomenology emerges as a projection $\Pi$ of the substrate's
  dynamics. Gauge mediators are reinterpreted as specific projection modes: the photon
  as scalar transmittance, and the $W/Z$ bosons as shear modes of the projection fiber,
  accounting for their mass without a fundamental Higgs field. Mass generation arises
  from the \emph{spectral overlap} between localized configurations and the global
  relaxation background. Strong interactions and confinement follow from the
  topological stability of knotted configurations ($Q=3$), where color charge reflects
  internal degrees of geometric coherence.

  Within the same projection-based ontology, the framework provides a unified
  interpretation of the dark sector. Dark Matter corresponds to non-projected
  spectral density contributing to inertia and gravitation without admitting a stable
  effective-field representation, while Dark Energy manifests as the global,
  irreversible relaxation flux of $\chi$.

  Cosmochrony does not aim to replace the Standard Model or General Relativity at
  accessible energies, but to supply a deeper explanatory layer in which their
  structures emerge from a common physical origin. The framework delineates explicit
  numerical programs for validation via lattice-based simulations and clarifies the
  regimes in which effective field theories and spacetime descriptions remain valid.
