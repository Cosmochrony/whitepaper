\abstract{
  We present \emph{Cosmochrony}, a foundational physical framework in which time, inertia,
  spacetime geometry, and mass emerge from the irreversible relaxation of a single
  pre-geometric relational substrate, denoted $\chi$.
  Rather than evolving from richly structured initial conditions, the Universe is
  described as originating from a regime of \emph{ontological poverty}, in which only a
  severely restricted class of simple and globally coherent $\chi$-configurations is
  admissible.
  As relaxation proceeds, this admissible space irreversibly expands, enabling the
  emergence of increasingly complex effective descriptions.
  Unlike conventional field theories formulated on a predefined spacetime manifold,
  Cosmochrony treats relaxation as the primary physical process, with spacetime and
  causality arising only as effective, projected descriptions of underlying
  $\chi$-configurations.

  A central feature of the framework is the non-injective projection from $\chi$
  to effective observables, which provides a structural origin for quantum
  indeterminacy, entanglement and nonlocal correlations, discreteness,
  and horizon phenomena.
  Within this setting, particle masses arise as invariant spectral properties of
  metastable $\chi$-configurations, stabilized by topological frustration and bounded
  relaxation.
  Particle decay is reinterpreted as a structural instability of projected
  $\chi$-configurations, corresponding to a loss of admissibility under continued
  relaxation rather than to stochastic or externally triggered processes.
  Quantum mechanics thus emerges as an effective statistical framework governing the
  admissible projections of a non-injective underlying reality.

  The effective dynamical laws are derived \emph{ab initio}.
  A Born--Infeld-like action emerges uniquely from the causal saturation of relaxation
  fluxes, while General Relativity appears as a thermodynamic and spectral continuum
  limit of the underlying relational dynamics.
  At galactic scales, saturation of the relaxation constraint yields an effective
  gravitational potential producing asymptotically flat rotation curves without invoking
  dark matter halos, in quantitative agreement with observed spiral galaxies.
  In strong-gravity regimes, black hole evaporation is reinterpreted as a discrete
  reprojection process of $\chi$, offering a structural resolution of the information
  paradox without invoking non-unitary evolution.

  Cosmochrony thus provides a minimal and unified ontological framework in which
  geometry, quantum phenomena, particle stability and decay, galactic dynamics,
  gravitation, and the observed growth of cosmological complexity arise as emergent
  harmonics of a single irreversible relaxation process, structured by non-injective
  projection.
