\abstract{
   We present \emph{Cosmochrony}, a foundational physical framework in which time, inertia,
   spacetime geometry, and mass emerge from the irreversible relaxation of a single
   pre-geometric relational substrate, denoted $\chi$.
   Unlike conventional field theories formulated on a predefined spacetime manifold,
   Cosmochrony treats relaxation as the primary physical process, with spacetime and
   causality arising only as effective, projected descriptions of underlying
   $\chi$-configurations.

   A central feature of the framework is the non-injective projection from $\chi$
   to effective observables, which provides a structural origin for quantum
   indeterminacy, discreteness, and horizon phenomena.
   Within this setting, particle masses are shown to arise as invariant spectral
   properties of stable $\chi$-configurations, resulting from topological frustration
   and inhibition of relaxation rather than from fundamental coupling constants
   or symmetry-breaking mechanisms.

   The effective dynamical laws are derived \emph{ab initio}.
   A Born--Infeld-like action emerges uniquely from the causal saturation of relaxation
   fluxes, while General Relativity appears as a thermodynamic and spectral continuum
   limit of the underlying relational dynamics.
   In strong-gravity regimes, black hole evaporation is reinterpreted as a discrete
   reprojection process of $\chi$, offering a structural resolution of the information
   paradox without invoking non-unitary evolution.

   Cosmochrony thus provides a minimal and unified ontological framework in which
   geometry, quantum phenomena, and gravitation arise as emergent harmonics of a single
   irreversible relaxation process.
