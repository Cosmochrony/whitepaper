\abstract{
  We present \emph{Cosmochrony}, a foundational physical framework in which time, spacetime geometry, inertia, mass, and
  interaction structure emerge from the irreversible relaxation of a single pre-geometric relational substrate, denoted
  $\chi$.
  Rather than postulating a richly structured initial state, the Universe is described as originating from a regime of
  \emph{ontological poverty}, characterized by a severely restricted space of admissible $\chi$-configurations.
  As relaxation proceeds, this admissible space irreversibly expands, enabling the emergence of increasingly complex
  effective descriptions.

  A central feature of the framework is the non-injective projection from $\chi$ to effective observables.
  This structural non-injectivity provides a unified origin for quantum indeterminacy, entanglement and nonlocal
  correlations, discreteness, and effective interaction symmetries, without invoking fundamental randomness or
  superluminal dynamics.
  Within this setting, particle-like excitations, inertial mass, and interaction properties arise as stable or
  metastable spectral features of the relaxation process.

  The effective dynamical laws of Cosmochrony are derived \emph{ab initio}.
  A Born--Infeld-like action emerges from causal saturation of relaxation fluxes, while General Relativity appears as an
  effective continuum limit of the underlying relational dynamics.
  Cosmological expansion, gravitational phenomenology, particle stability and decay, and horizon phenomena are recovered
  as regime-dependent manifestations of the same underlying process.

  Cosmochrony thus provides a minimal and internally coherent ontological framework in which geometry, quantum
  phenomena, and cosmological structure arise as emergent features of a single irreversible relaxation dynamics
  structured by non-injective projection.
