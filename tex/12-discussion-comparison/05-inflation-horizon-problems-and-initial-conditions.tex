\subsection{Inflation, Horizon Problems, and Initial Conditions}
    \label{subsec:inflation-horizon-problems-and-initial-conditions}

  Standard inflationary theory addresses the horizon, flatness, and monopole problems by positing a brief phase of
  accelerated expansion driven by an inflaton field.
  In Cosmochrony, these issues are approached differently.

  Because $\chi$ defines a global relaxation process rather than a metric expansion imposed externally, causal connectivity
  is preserved at the level of the underlying wave field.
  Large-scale coherence arises from the initial smoothness of $\chi$ and its subsequent monotonic evolution, potentially
  alleviating the need for a distinct inflationary epoch.

  Nevertheless, a detailed treatment of primordial perturbations and their imprint on the cosmic microwave
  background (CMB) remains necessary to fully assess the equivalence or divergence between Cosmochrony and
  inflationary predictions.
