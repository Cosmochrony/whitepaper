\section{Discussion and Comparison with Existing Frameworks}
  \label{sec:discussion-and-comparison-with-existing-frameworks}

The Cosmochrony framework proposes a minimal geometric substrate, described by a single scalar field $\chi(x,t)$,
whose irreversible relaxation governs both microscopic and cosmological phenomena.
In this section, we discuss how this approach relates to established theoretical frameworks, highlight its conceptual
implications, and identify open challenges.
