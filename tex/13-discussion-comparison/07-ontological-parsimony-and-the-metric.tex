\subsection{Ontological Parsimony and the Metric}
  \label{subsec:ontological-parsimony-and-the-metric}

  As emphasized throughout the preceding discussion, the spectral operator relevant
  for mass generation is defined independently of any emergent geometric or
  dynamical description.
  A potential criticism of Cosmochrony is that it merely replaces one geometric
  structure (the spacetime metric) with another fundamental entity (the $\chi$
  field).
  This subsection clarifies why this replacement constitutes genuine ontological
  simplification rather than a relabeling of degrees of freedom.

  \paragraph{Distinction from metric-based theories.}
    In General Relativity and related metric frameworks:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item the metric $g_{\mu\nu}$ is a fundamental tensor field with ten independent
      components,
      \item spacetime curvature is treated as a primitive geometric property,
      \item matter and energy are conceptually distinct from geometry and are coupled
      to it via the stress--energy tensor.
    \end{itemize}

    In Cosmochrony:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item only a single scalar field $\chi$ is taken as fundamental,
      \item the spacetime metric arises as an effective, coarse-grained descriptor of
      $\chi$ dynamics and is not an independent dynamical entity,
      \item matter, energy, and geometry correspond to different regimes and
      configurations of the same underlying field.
    \end{itemize}

  \paragraph{Operational distinguishability.}
    The two frameworks are operationally distinct rather than notationally
    equivalent:
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item \textbf{Degrees of freedom:} General Relativity propagates two tensorial
      gravitational-wave polarizations derived from the metric structure.
      In Cosmochrony, only perturbations of the scalar field $\chi$ propagate at the
      fundamental level, with effective tensorial behavior emerging only in the
      macroscopic regime.

      \item \textbf{Singularities:} In metric theories, singularities correspond to
      divergences of the fundamental geometric structure.
      In Cosmochrony, apparent singular behavior signals the breakdown of the
      effective geometric description, while the underlying $\chi$ field remains
      well-defined.

      \item \textbf{Quantum regime:} Quantizing General Relativity requires the
      quantization of the metric itself (e.g., via the Wheeler--DeWitt equation).
      In Cosmochrony, only the scalar field $\chi$ is quantized, with spacetime
      geometry emerging from quantum configurations of this field~\cite{Rovelli1997}.
    \end{enumerate}

  \paragraph{Ontological economy.}
    From the perspective of ontological parsimony, Cosmochrony achieves unification
    through reduction rather than proliferation:
    \begin{align}
      \text{Standard approach:} \quad
      & g_{\mu\nu} \; (\text{geometry}) + \psi \; (\text{matter}) + \Lambda \;
      (\text{dark energy}), \\
      \text{Cosmochrony:} \quad
      & \chi \; (\text{single fundamental degree of freedom})
      \;\longrightarrow\; \{\text{spacetime}, \text{matter}, \text{expansion}\}.
    \end{align}

    This reduction does not merely rephrase existing structures, but offers an
    explanatory compression in which multiple physical notions arise from a single
    underlying dynamical principle.
